# Predict-Employee-Attrition
The Predict Employee Attrition project aims to develop a machine learning classification model that can identify whether an employee is likely to leave a company. Employee attrition is a major concern for organizations as it leads to high recruitment costs, knowledge loss, and decreased productivity. By leveraging historical HR data, this model analyzes key features such as job satisfaction, salary, work environment, years of experience, and other employee-related factors to predict the probability of attrition.

The project involves steps like data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and interpretation using tools from Pythonâ€™s data science ecosystem. A Random Forest Classifier was chosen due to its accuracy, interpretability, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data. The final model not only provides reliable predictions but also offers valuable insights into which factors most influence employee turnover, supporting HR departments in making proactive, data-driven decisions
